# Overview
This is a project for my Internship Training (Year 1) of Cavendish University. The purpose of this project is to practice whatever I have learnt in my first year as a Cavendish Student. In this project, I will be building a Wifi Login Page for anyone trying to connect to the Library's Wifi. Furthermore, this project is being built to promote awareness of the various library resources available to students and the wider community whilst also promoting rules and regulations of the library. In this project, I will be building with only HTML and CSS as taught in my first Year in Cavendish University.
